h1. vimbacore: a sample c# project built with vim + albacore

this is just a test / playground for me to find out what features and functionality I want in the 'csc' (c# compiler) task for [albacore:http://github.com/derickbailey/albacore]. 

if you would like to build this and run it for your own learning experience, you'll need to build and install the 'dev' branch of albacore.

h1. legal mumbo, now with more jumbo
